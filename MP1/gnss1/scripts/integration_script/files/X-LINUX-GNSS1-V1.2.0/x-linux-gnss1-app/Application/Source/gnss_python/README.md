
## GNSS Python Application Description

Application for reading GNSS (Teseo-LIV3F or Teseo-VIC3DA) data over UART using Python.X-NUCLEO-GNSS1A1(Teseo-LIV3F) and X-NUCLEO-GNSS2A1(Teseo-VIC3DA) is mounted on the Arduino Connector of STM32MP157F-DK2 board .

Example Description:

Plug the X-NUCLEO-GNSS1A1 or X-NUCLEO-GNSS2A1 expansion board on the Arduino Connector of STM32MP157F-DK2 board . Power the STM32MP157F-DK2 using USB Type C Cable.Transfer the device tree \Application\Binaries\stm32mp157f-dk2.dtb to /boot of the board using scp .Transfer the Application\Source\gnss_pynmea2.py to the STM32MP157F-DK2 board using scp command. In the terminal run the command python3 gnss_pynmea2.GNSS NMEA Data will start appearing on the screen:

When using this application along with a serial terminal Utility (e.g. TeraTerm on Windows) all messages coming from the Nucleo Board are printed on the screen.
### Keywords

GNSS, I2C, UART, VCOM

### Directory contents

 gnss_pynmea2.py Python Application to read the GNSS NMEA data over Serial UART.The data is read from the /dev/ttySTM2
 
  
### Hardware and Software environment

This example runs on the STM32MP157F-DK2 using STM32 MPU OpenSTLinux Distribution software using X-NUCLEO-GNSS1A1 or X-NUCLEO-GNSS2A1
Pyserial and Pynmea must be installed on the STM32MP1-DK2 board

For more details see Development Toolchains and Compilers and Supported Devices and Boards Section in Release_Notes.html


  
### How to use it?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

Use pre-built device tree and application binary to enable the UART and I2C : \Application\Binaries\stm32mp157f-dk2.dtb and Application\Binaries\gnss_pynmea2.py
