### Testing/integration scripts

1. Typically test/Integration scripts should be Board variant independent

2. If they are Board dependent, have scripts name similar to recipe name, for e.g.

recipes_157fdk2  --> test_script_157fdk2

3. These scripts will be used in jenkins for integarting yocto recipes into Build system
